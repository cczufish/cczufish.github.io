2. 1 Performance: App Completeness
2. 3 Performance: Accurate Metadata
Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed


We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we need access to a video that demonstrates your app in use on a physical iOS device.

Please demonstrate the following features of your app:
1. Background audio


Please ensure the video you provide shows a physical iOS device (not a simulator).

Next Steps

To help us proceed with the review of your app, please provide us with a link to a demo video in the App Review Information section of iTunes Connect and reply to this message in Resolution Center.

To provide a link to a demo video:

- Log in to iTunes Connect

- Scroll down to "App Review Information"

Once this information is available, we can continue with the review of your app.

Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed


We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we need additional information about your app.

Next Steps

To help us proceed with the review of your app, please review the following questions and provide as much detailed information as you can.

- Does your app access any paid content or services?
- What are the paid content or services, and what are the costs?
- Do individual customers pay for the content or services?
- If no, does a company or organization pay for the content or services?
- Where do they pay, and what's the payment method?
- If users create an account to use your app, are there fees involved?

Once you reply to this message in Resolution Center with the requested information, we can proceed with your review.

Guideline 2.3.8 - Performance - Accurate Metadata


We noticed your app name, subtitle, icon, or screenshots to be displayed on the App Store includes the term 少儿, which implies that this app is made specifically for children. However, this app was not submitted as a Kids category app.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your app category and select the Kids category for this app. Please note that all Kids category apps must comply with the Kids category-specific sections of the App Store Review Guidelines.

If this app is not meant solely for children, it would be appropriate to remove any terms from your app name, subtitle, icon, or screenshots that imply the main audience of this app is children.



给苹果拍了一段视频，用百度网盘发过去，然后。。。。

We have started the review of your app, but we are not able to continue because we could not directly access the video that your provided. Please make sure the the access of the video does not require registration or login.


然后又是再来一次，加了文字回复。。。。。

我们的官网地址：

我们的app主要是专注于4-12岁孩子数学思维的开发和培养，孩子和老师是一对一在线直播上课的，上课是在家长的监护陪同时进行的。另外我们的app没有内购的场景，家长通过线下报名付费，我们给每个家长分配一个账号，学生在规定的时间在父母陪同下打开app和我们的老师一起上课。每一节课上课前都会有一个预习视频，点课程日历列表中的预习按钮开始播放视频，学生预习完在课前5分钟点击进入教室按钮就可以进入开始上课了。

Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase


We noticed that your app provides access to external payment mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the app, which is not appropriate for the App Store.

Specifically, we found that your app allows users to access content that is paid outside of the app.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please remove any external payment mechanisms from this app. If you feel that we have misunderstood how your app uses this payment mechanism, please respond to this message and explain what users are able to purchase via this payment mechanism and how we can locate the purchases in your app.


您好，感谢您审核我们的应用程序：

我们的app主要是专注于4-12岁孩子数学思维的开发和培养，孩子和老师是一对一和一对六在线直播的方式上课的，上课是在家长的监护陪同时进行的。家长通过线下报名付费， 因为作为一家在线教育公司提供教学服务，我们只需要我们的客户在我们的应用程序中上课。用户支付在教学过程中产生的人工成本和教学教研成本，并不会购买仅在APP中需要的信息，所以没有内购的场景。

Hello,

Thank you for your response.

Regarding the 3.1.1 issue, it would be appropriate to implement in-app purchase.

We look forward to your resubmission.

Best regards,

您好：

我们的app是给学生上课用的，没有应用内支付，学生通过线下购买充值卡，卡里包含上课使用的次数，这个钱都支付给了老师，我们的场景不符合苹果要求内购的任何一个条款，在中国很多这样的公司都在做类似的业务，比如说51talk.com,vipkid.com.cn等等都是在做的在线教育，他们的app审核也没有走内购。麻烦您再看看审核的标准。


审核通过了，xcode9.2打包的程序在ios8上有bug。。。。。。。

3. 1.1 Business: Payments - In-App Purchase
Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase


We noticed that your app or its metadata enables the purchase of content, services, or functionality in the app by means other than the in-app purchase API, which is not appropriate for the App Store.

Specifically, your app allows users to access content that is paid outside of the app.

The next submission of this app may require a longer review time, and this app will not be eligible for an expedited review until this issue is resolved.

Next Steps

- Review the In-App Purchase section of the App Store Review Guidelines.
- Ensure your app is compliant with all sections of the App Store Review Guidelines and the Terms & Conditions of the Apple Developer Program.
- Once your app is fully compliant, resubmit your app for review.

If you believe your app is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines, you may submit an appeal. Alternatively, you may provide additional details about your app by replying directly to this message.

In-App Purchase

It may be appropriate to revise your app to use the in-app purchase API to provide content purchasing functionality.

In-app purchase provides several benefits, including:

- The flexibility to support a variety of business models.
- Impacting your app ranking by consolidating your sales to one app rather than distributing them across multiple apps.
- An effective marketing vehicle to drive additional sales of new content.

For information on in-app purchase, please refer to the following documentation:

In-App Purchase for Developers

In-App Purchase Programming Guide

For step-by-step instructions on in-app purchase creation within iTunes Connect, refer to In-App Purchase for Developers.


我们的app主要是专注于4-12岁孩子数学思维的开发和培养，孩子和老师是一对一和一对六在线直播的方式上课的，上课是在家长的监护陪同时进行的。 因为作为一家在线教育公司提供教学服务，我们只需要我们的客户在我们的应用程序中上课，并不会购买仅在APP中需要的信息，所以没有内购的场景。 老师端可以随时进入教室，学生端会在课前10分钟才能进入教室，图中的倒计时代表离上课还有多少时间，您当前的时间是11:03am，课程开始时间是15:00pm，距离上课时间还有3:57:33，课前学生可以通过预习了解上课内容，当时间到了14:50学生就可以进入教室了，不需要支付。



3.1.3 “Reader” Apps: Apps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as educational apps that manage student grades and schedules), as well as consumable items in multi-platform games, provided that you agree not to directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods are not designed to discourage use of in-app purchase.

*         3. 1.1 Business: Payments - In-App Purchase
Hello,

Thank you for your response. In regards of the 3.1.1 rejection, we found that your app allows user to purchase classes by means other than the in-app purchase API, which is not appropriate for the App Store. It would be appropriate to implement in-app purchase for the one to many classes before resubmitting for review.

We hope you can make the necessary revision and we look forward to review your app again.

Best regards,

TestFlight Beta Review
