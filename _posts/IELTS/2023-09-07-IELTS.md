IELTS Speaking Tea and coffee  

Part 1

Question 1

Do people like tea and coffee nowadays ?

Yes, people around the world definitely enjoy tea and coffee.
 Tea is especially popular in many cultures, including China, India.
 Coffee has also become a global phenomenon with its popularity increasing rapidly in recent years.


Question 2

What is your favorite drink ?

Personally, I enjoy both tea and coffee. I particularly like black tea , 
which is a traditional Chinese way of serving tea. However, I also enjoy a good cup of coffee, 
especially when it's served with a bit of milk and sugar.

Question 3

How often do you drink tea or coffee ?

I would say I drink tea and coffee pretty much every day. 
Tea is a traditional Chinese beverage, so it's something I often have with meals 
or as a late afternoon treat. As for coffee, I usually have it first thing in the morning 
or when I'm feeling a bit tired during the day.


Question 4

Do you prefer to use tea or coffee to serve your guests ?

"Personally, I prefer to serve tea to my guests because I think tea has a more relaxing 
and enjoyable atmosphere than coffee. Tea has a unique aroma and taste that 
can help people relax and unwind. Also, tea is considered a traditional beverage in many cultures, 
so it can also add a sense of hospitality and cultural value to the experience of serving guests. 
However, I am also aware that coffee is also a popular beverage, 
so I would consider serving coffee to guests if they prefer it or ask for it."

Question 5

When was the last time you had a cup of coffee or tea ?

The last time I had coffee was yesterday afternoon. I was feeling a little tired 
and needed to wake myself up, so I brewed a cup of coffee and sat down to read a book. The book was very interesting and I couldn't put it down, so I kept drinking the coffee and reading until it was dark outside. 
The coffee helped me feel more awake and I was able to concentrate better on my reading.

Question 6

Do you usually buy your coffee in a coffee shop ?

I do not usually buy coffee in a coffee shop. Instead, I usually make coffee at home 
using a coffee maker. However, sometimes I go to a coffee shop to buy coffee 
when I am out and about or when I want to treat myself to a special cup of coffee. 
In the coffee shop, I like to enjoy the atmosphere and watch people go 
by while sipping my coffee. It's a great way to relax and unwind.
