雅思口语 Transport


Question 1


How do you go to work or go to school?


I usually take the subway to work or school in Beijing. There are many convenient subway lines in Beijing, and I can go to most places within an hour. The subway is also a more environmentally friendly way to travel compared to driving or taking a taxi. Plus, I can read or relax on the subway without being stuck in traffic jams.


Question 2

What’s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown ?


In Beijing, the most popular means of transportation is the subway. Beijing has a large network of subway lines that cover most parts of the city. The subway is fast, convenient, and relatively inexpensive, making it a popular choice for many people. In addition, the subway is also a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation compared to driving or taking a taxi.



Question 3

How far is it from  your home to work or to school ?


It's about 8 kilometers from my home to work, and it takes about 30 minutes to get to work on the subway. As for the distance from my home to school, it's about 10 kilometers, and I usually cycle to school because it's not far and also good for my health.



Question 4

Do you think people will drive more in the future ?


It's hard to say whether people will drive more in the future, as it depends on many factors such as the development of technology, the improvement of public transportation, and the change of people's travel habits.
Personally, I think that as the traffic congestion and air pollution in cities become increasingly serious, more people may choose to use public transportation or other environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as cycling or walking. At the same time, with the development of technology, electric vehicles may also become more popular in the future, reducing the demand for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.
However, if the infrastructure and management of public transportation cannot keep up with the demand, people may still choose to drive. In addition, the rise of self-driving technology may also affect people's travel methods. If self-driving technology becomes more mature and widely used, it may indeed increase the number of people who drive.
In short, the future trend of people's travel methods is difficult to predict, but it will be affected by many factors. We can only hope that more environmentally friendly modes of transportation will become more popular in the future.
