IELTS Speaking Robots  

Part 1

Question 1

Are robots important ?

Robots have always been important in the development of technology,
 and they will continue to be so in the future. Robots can help us complete tasks 
that are difficult or dangerous for humans, such as exploring space or working in environments 
that are harmful to human health. In addition, robots can also help us improve our productivity 
and efficiency in many fields, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture. 
Therefore, I think robots are very important for our society and will continue to be so in the future.

Question 2

What are the uses of robots ?

Robots are used in many different fields. For example, they can be used in manufacturing
 to assemble and inspect products. They can also be used in healthcare to assist doctors and nurses 
in surgery and patient care. In addition, robots are also used in the military to perform missions 
that are too dangerous for humans. In general, robots have become an integral part of our society 
and will continue to expand their applications in the future.

Question 3

What are the differences between domestic robots and industrial robots ?

Domestic robots and industrial robots have some differences in their applications and functions. Domestic robots are mainly used to perform household tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and taking care of the elderly and children. They can help us simplify our daily lives and improve our quality of life. On the other hand, industrial robots are mainly used to perform repetitive and precision tasks in factories and workshops. They can help us improve productivity and efficiency in manufacturing and logistics. Therefore, the main differences between domestic robots and industrial robots are their applications and functions, but both can contribute to the development of society.

Question 4

Would robots affect people’s lives ?

Robots can indeed affect people's lives. On the one hand, robots can help us complete tasks 
that are difficult or dangerous for humans, such as exploring space or working in environments 
that are harmful to human health. In addition, robots can also help us improve our productivity 
and efficiency in many fields, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture. Therefore, 
robots can help us improve our lives and work conditions. On the other hand, robots may also create 
some employment problems, because robots can replace some human work, resulting in the loss of 
some jobs. Therefore, we need to take a positive attitude to the development of technology, 
while also facing the impact on employment and other problems caused by it.

Question 5

Have you ever watched a movie about robots ?

Yes, I have watched many movies about robots. Some of them are "Terminator", "Transformers", 
"A.I. Artificial Intelligence", and many more. These movies show how robots can help us solve problems 
and save the world, but also how they can be dangerous and create conflicts.
 It's really interesting to see how movie creators imagine the future and the role of robots in our society.

Question 6

Should we let a robot drive for us for  a long journeys?

For a long journey, I think we should not rely too much on robots to drive for us. 
Although robots can drive very well, they may not be able to react as quickly as humans 
in complex and changing environments. In addition, if the robot fails during the journey, 
it may pose a great threat to the safety of the passengers. Therefore, I think we should 
let a robot drive for us for a long journeys after assessing the risks and ensuring the safety of the passengers.

Question 7

What can robots do for you at home ?

Robots can do many things for me at home. They can help me clean the house, cook, wash clothes, 
and so on. In addition, some robots can also be used to monitor the home environment, 
such as monitoring the temperature and humidity, and detecting whether there is a fire or a leak. 
These robots can help us detect problems and take appropriate action as soon as possible, 
ensuring the safety of the home. In short, robots can help us improve our quality of life and ensure our safety at home.
